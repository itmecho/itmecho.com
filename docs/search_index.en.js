you're writing a script, sometimes it can be helpful to set a default for a variable. If the variable is optional, this can often remove the need to check if a variable is set before using it and also help keep your output nicely formatted and easy to read. The following script will have different outputs based upon the environment variables we set:\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Variable with a default\n# This will be overwridden even when it is set to an empty string\necho \"with_default: '${with_default-default}'\"\n\n# Variable with a strict default\n# This will be overwridden unless it is set to an empty string\necho \"with_strict_default: '${with_strict_default:-default}'\"\n\n# Variable without a default\necho \"no_default: '${no_default}'\"\n\nRunning this script without setting any of the variables will give the following output:\n$ ./default-envs\nwith_default: 'default'\nwith_strict_default: 'default'\nno_default: ''\n\nWe can override those variables by setting them before running the script or, like in this example, at runtime:\n$ with_default=test1 \\\n\twith_strict_default=test2 \\\n\tno_default=test3 \\\n\t./default-envs\nwith_default: 'test1'\nwith_strict_default: 'test2'\nno_default: 'test3'\n\nHere you can see that all 3 variables were overridden. Now lets try the same thing but set the variables to empty strings:\n$ with_default=\"\" \\\n\twith_strict_default=\"\" \\\n\tno_default=\"\" \\\n\t./default-envs\nwith_default: ''\nwith_strict_default: 'default'\nno_default: ''\n\nThe first and last variables were overridden but the second variable used the default value. This is due to the strict mode which ignores the variable passed in if it was set to an empty string.\n","id":"https://itmecho.com/blog/set-defaults-for-environment-variables/","title":"Set defaults for environment variables"},"https://itmecho.com/blog/systemd-unit-failure-notification/":{"body":"In this post, we will be configuring a systemd unit which will send a notification to a slack channel when a systemd unit enters the failed state. This is achieved using the OnFailure setting in the Unit section.\nThe alerting script\nWe start off by creating a script which will be run by the systemd unit. This script takes one argument, the name of the unit that failed and sends a formatted message to a slack webhook.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set your slack webhook url here\nSLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=\"\"\n\nunit=$1\n\nread -d '' payload &lt;&lt; EOF\n{\n    \"icon_emoji\": \":fire:\",\n    \"username\": \"alertbot\",\n    \"attachments\": [\n        {\n            \"fallback\": \"Systemd: ${unit} failed to start\",\n            \"color\": \"danger\",\n            \"title\": \"Systemd: ${unit} failed to start\",\n            \"text\": \"The ${unit} systemd unit failed to start!\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\nEOF\n\ncurl \\\n        --silent \\\n        --output /dev/null \\\n        -X POST \\\n        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n        --data \"${payload}\" $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL\n\nOnce you've set the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL variable, feel free to test the script using the following command:\n/usr/local/bin/systemd-alert test\n\nNOTE: Don't forget to make the script executable using chmod 700 /usr/local/bin/systemd-alert\nYou should see an alert in your configured slack channel with the message:\n\nSystemd: test failed to start\n\nThe systemd alerting unit\nNext up we're creating a systemd unit that will be started when another unit fails. Create the file /lib/systemd/system/systemd-alert@.service with the content:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Systemd alert\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/systemd-alert %i\nRestart=never\n\nThis is a super simple unit which will just execute the script /usr/local/bin/systemd-alert, passing the instance name as an argument. The instance name is defined when we start the unit by adding it after the @ symbol in the service file name.\nExample: sudo systemctl start systemd-alert@test.service will execute /usr/local/bin/systemd-alert test\nTriggering the alert\nFinally, we just need to add the OnFailure setting to the Unit section of another systemd unit we want to be alerted for. Once that unit enters the failed state, systemd will start the unit specified by OnFailure, sending the alert notification.\n[Unit]\n...\nOnFailure=systemd-alert@nginx.service\n\n[Service]\n...\n\nWith that done, we should be good to go! You can test it out by making sure your unit will fail (maybe make a typo in the ExecStart command) and starting it.\nThis is very useful for dynamic environments such as applications running on AWS Spot Instances as you will recieve an alert if your server fails to start a critical service which could otherwise go unnoticed. In an upcoming blog post, I will be talking about how to use a tool named germinate to enrich the alert message with data from other sources at runtime. For example, loading the value of an AWS EC2 instance tag to get more context.\n","id":"https://itmecho.com/blog/systemd-unit-failure-notification/","title":"Systemd unit failure notification"}},"docInfo":{"https://itmecho.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://itmecho.com/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://itmecho.com/blog/set-defaults-for-environment-variables/":{"body":139,"title":4},"https://itmecho.com/blog/systemd-unit-failure-notification/":{"body":271,"title":4}},"length":4},"lang":"English"};
