off, I'll give a brief overview of my SSH setup. I use gpg-agent's SSH functionality as an SSH agent which gives me the benefit of automatically caching the key password after prompting for it once. This persists across all my terminals and programs which is great as when I'm running an ansible playbook that pulls in a lot of private role dependencies, I don't have to constantly put my password in. I used this guide to set up SSH to use the gpg-agent.\nThe Problem\nI've been testing out SSH certificate solutions recently for work, mainly Pritunl Zero and Teleport. As part of the process I generated a key with a length less than 2048. Everything seemed fine and I was able to use key to connect to the nodes so I didn't notice the issue straight away. Then I tried pushing to a repository with a password protected key and I got a prompt in my terminal for my password which is unusual as normally I get a GTK pop up for that. I then tried to push again and it asked for my password again so I knew that my SSH agent wasn't working properly.\nI thought I could fix the issue by removing the identities from the SSH agent using ssh-add but it didn't seem to make a difference.\n$ ssh-add -L\nerror fetching identities: Invalid key length\n$ ssh-add -D\nAll identities removed.\n$ ssh-add -L\nerror fetching identities: Invalid key length\n\nI made a post on reddit about it but I didn't get any responses for 7 days. At this point, it was annoying me enough to have another crack at it.\nThe Solution\nAfter some digging around online, I found gpg-connect-agent which let me run commands against the agent directly. I tried a load of different commands until I found I could list the SSH keys in the agent with their fingerprints. This made it easy to identify which keys shouldn't be there any more as I could match the keygrips with the MD5 checksums of the SSH public keys in my ~/.ssh folder.\nFirst off I removed the keys I'd generated for pritunl zero and teleport and listed the MD5 checksums of the remaining public keys in my ~/.ssh folder\nfor f in $(ls ~/.ssh/*.pub); do\n  ssh-keygen -l -E md5 -f ~/.ssh/$f\ndone\n\nNext I connected to the agent and listed the SSH keys\ngpg-connect-agent \"KEYINFO --ssh-list --ssh-fpr\" /bye\n\nThen I deleted the keys that weren't in my SSH folder one by one. Each deletion had a pop up asking for confirmation to delete the key and included the comment associated with key so it was easy to check I wasn't removing one of my active keys.\ngpg-connect-agent \"DELETE_KEY SOMELONGKEYGRIP\" /bye\n\nSuccess! The ssh-add -L error had gone and when I tried pulling from a repo, I got the GTK pinentry pop up. Pulling again just worked without the pinentry and I was back to normal!\n","id":"https://itmecho.com/blog/fixing-gpg-agent-ssh-after-adding-short-key/","title":"Fixing gpg-agent-ssh after adding short key"},"https://itmecho.com/blog/sending-system-logs-to-datadog-using-fluentbit/":{"body":"In this post, we'll be using a tool called fluentbit to send logs to a log aggregation platform, in this case Datadog. fluentbit allows us to process and enrich our logs before sending them to add additional context. This is extremely useful when trying to hunt down the cause of an issue.\nfluentbit\nfluentbit is a light weight tool written in C to collect, parse, filter, and send logs to multiple outputs including stdout, files, and external providers like Datadog. It is part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation as a subproject of fluentd. fluentd can do everything fluentbit can, however it's written in ruby (and C) which is not as easy to deploy as the single binary you get with fluentbit due to the possibility that the plugins will have dependency version conflicts. You can read the docs for a more in depth comparison.\nInstallation\nWe'll be using Debian 10 (Buster) but the documentation has installation guides for other systems. The packaged versions of fluentbit go under the name td-agent-bit as the packages are maintained by Treasure Data, the original creators of fluentd. To get it installed, use the following commands:\n$ wget -qO - https://packages.fluentbit.io/fluentbit.key | sudo apt-key add -\n$ echo 'deb https://packages.fluentbit.io/debian/buster buster main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/td-agent-bit.list\n$ sudo apt-get update\n$ sudo apt-get install td-agent-bit\n\nWe should now have the /opt/td-agent-bit and /etc/td-agent-bit directories as well as a systemd unit available. Use the following commands to check that everything is ready to go\n$ /opt/td-agent-bit/bin/td-agent-bit --version\n$ sudo systemctl status td-agent-bit.service\n\nNow we're ready to move onto configuring fluentbit!\nConfiguration\nThe default configuration file can be found at /etc/td-agent-bit/td-agent-bit.conf and contains configuration to output cpu stats to stdout:\n[SERVICE]\n    # Flush\n    # =====\n    # Set an interval of seconds before to flush records to a destination\n    Flush        5\n\n    # Daemon\n    # ======\n    # Instruct Fluent Bit to run in foreground or background mode.\n    Daemon       Off\n\n    # Log_Level\n    # =========\n    # Set the verbosity level of the service, values can be:\n    #\n    # - error\n    # - warning\n    # - info\n    # - debug\n    # - trace\n    #\n    # By default 'info' is set, that means it includes 'error' and 'warning'.\n    Log_Level    info\n\n    # Parsers_File\n    # ============\n    # Specify an optional 'Parsers' configuration file\n    Parsers_File parsers.conf\n    Plugins_File plugins.conf\n\n    # HTTP Server\n    # ===========\n    # Enable/Disable the built-in HTTP Server for metrics\n    HTTP_Server  Off\n    HTTP_Listen  0.0.0.0\n    HTTP_Port    2020\n\n[INPUT]\n    Name cpu\n    Tag  cpu.local\n    # Interval Sec\n    # ====\n    # Read interval (sec) Default: 1\n    Interval_Sec 1\n\n[OUTPUT]\n    Name  stdout\n    Match *\n\nThis configuration has 3 sections:\n\nSERVICE - general configuration options\nINPUT - a cpu input which will collect cpu metrics every 1 second\nOUTPUT - match all our logs and send them to std out\n\nStart the fluentbit service and check the output.\n$ sudo systemctl start td-agent-bit.service\n$ journalctl -fu td-agent-bit.service\n...\n[0] cpu.local: [1592420609.822015943, {\"cpu_p\"=&gt;2.500000, \"user_p\"=&gt;2.250000, \"system_p\"=&gt;0.250000, ... }]\n[1] cpu.local: [1592420610.821908722, {\"cpu_p\"=&gt;5.875000, \"user_p\"=&gt;3.750000, \"system_p\"=&gt;2.125000, ... }]\n...\n\nEverything looks good so we're ready to start modifying the configuration to collect system logs and send them to Datadog. First we want to clear out the default input and add our systemd input. Once we've done that (and removed the comments) we will have something that looks like this:\n[SERVICE]\n    Flush        5\n    Daemon       Off\n    Log_Level    info\n    Parsers_File parsers.conf\n    Plugins_File plugins.conf\n    HTTP_Server  Off\n\n[INPUT]\n    Name systemd\n    Tag systemd.*\n\n[OUTPUT]\n    Name stdout\n    Match *\n\nRestart the td-agent-bit service again and check the logs. You should see the systemd unit logs start to appear after the 5 second flush interval. Now we are ready to change the output to send the logs to Datadog! All you need to do for that is get an API key and add the output to our configuration.\n[OUTPUT]\n    Name        datadog\n    Match       *\n    Host        http-intake.logs.datadoghq.eu\n    apikey      DATADOG_API_KEY\n\nNow all that's left to do is restart the td-agent-bit service and we should start seeing logs appearing in Datadog!\nBonus: Remapping fields\nIf we look at our logs in Datadog, we can see that the host and service fields are blank. However, the logs do contain this information.\n\nInstead of configuring Datadog to use these fields, we can remap them using fluentbit. Adding the following FILTER section will rename the _HOSTNAME field to host and the SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER field to service. Make sure to add this section between the INPUT and OUTPUT sections.\n[FILTER]\n    Name modify\n    Match systemd.*\n    Rename _HOSTNAME host\n    Rename SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER service\n\nRestart the service and check Datadog again. You should now see that the host and service fields are set correctly.\n\n","id":"https://itmecho.com/blog/sending-system-logs-to-datadog-using-fluentbit/","title":"Sending system logs to Datadog using fluentbit"},"https://itmecho.com/blog/set-defaults-for-environment-variables/":{"body":"If you're writing a script, sometimes it can be helpful to set a default for a variable.

This script takes one argument, the name of the unit that failed and sends a formatted message to a slack webhook.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Set your slack webhook url here\nSLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=\"\"\n\nunit=$1\n\nread -d '' payload &lt;&lt; EOF\n{\n    \"icon_emoji\": \":fire:\",\n    \"username\": \"alertbot\",\n    \"attachments\": [\n        {\n            \"fallback\": \"Systemd: ${unit} failed to start\",\n            \"color\": \"danger\",\n            \"title\": \"Systemd: ${unit} failed to start\",\n            \"text\": \"The ${unit} systemd unit failed to start!\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\nEOF\n\ncurl \\\n        --silent \\\n        --output /dev/null \\\n        -X POST \\\n        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n        --data \"${payload}\" $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL\n\nOnce you've set the SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL variable, feel free to test the script using the following command:\n/usr/local/bin/systemd-alert test\n\nNOTE: Don't forget to make the script executable using chmod 700 /usr/local/bin/systemd-alert\nYou should see an alert in your configured slack channel with the message:\n\nSystemd: test failed to start\n\nThe systemd alerting unit\nNext up we're creating a systemd unit that will be started when another unit fails. Create the file /lib/systemd/system/systemd-alert@.service with the content:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Systemd alert\n\n[Service]\nType=oneshot\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/systemd-alert %i\nRestart=never\n\nThis is a super simple unit which will just execute the script /usr/local/bin/systemd-alert, passing the instance name as an argument. The instance name is defined when we start the unit by adding it after the @ symbol in the service file name.\nExample: sudo systemctl start systemd-alert@test.service will execute /usr/local/bin/systemd-alert test\nTriggering the alert\nFinally, we just need to add the OnFailure setting to the Unit section of another systemd unit we want to be alerted for. Once that unit enters the failed state, systemd will start the unit specified by OnFailure, sending the alert notification.\n[Unit]\n...\nOnFailure=systemd-alert@nginx.service\n\n[Service]\n...\n\nWith that done, we should be good to go! You can test it out by making sure your unit will fail (maybe make a typo in the ExecStart command) and starting it.\nThis is very useful for dynamic environments such as applications running on AWS Spot Instances as you will recieve an alert if your server fails to start a critical service which could otherwise go unnoticed. In an upcoming blog post, I will be talking about how to use a tool named germinate to enrich the alert message with data from other sources at runtime. For example, loading the value of an AWS EC2 instance tag to get more context.\n","id":"https://itmecho.com/blog/systemd-unit-failure-notification/","title":"Systemd unit failure notification"}},"docInfo":{"https://itmecho.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://itmecho.com/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://itmecho.com/blog/fixing-gpg-agent-ssh-after-adding-short-key/":{"body":287,"title":7},"https://itmecho.com/blog/sending-system-logs-to-datadog-using-fluentbit/":{"body":485,"title":6},"https://itmecho.com/blog/set-defaults-for-environment-variables/":{"body":139,"title":4},"https://itmecho.com/blog/setting-path-in-config-fish/":{"body":184,"title":3},"https://itmecho.com/blog/systemd-unit-failure-notification/":{"body":271,"title":4}},"length":7},"lang":"English"};
