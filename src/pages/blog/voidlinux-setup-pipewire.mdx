<Link external href="https://pipewire.org/">Pipewire</Link> is a modern approach to multimedia handling in Linux. It aims to improve the experience of working with media within Linux and can be a drop-in replacement for both <Link external href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/">PulseAudio</Link> and <Link external href="https://jackaudio.org/">JACK</Link>. In this post, we'll be setting up the pipewire pulseaudio service to handle audio inputs and outputs.

## Installation
Pipewire is available in the default Void repo so all we need to do is:

```sh
sudo xbps-install pipewire
```

If you haven't set up the default repository, you can run this instead
```sh
sudo xbps-install -R https://repo-default.void-linux.org/current -S pipewire
```

In this command, we specifically tell `xbps-install` to use the default repository with the `-R` flag, sync the repository with `-S`, and install the `pipewire` package.

## Setting up the environment

### `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
`pipewire-pulse` uses the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` path to store it's runtime files. This environment variable isn't set by default so we need to set it and make sure the directory is writeable by the user. To achieve this, I followed the <Link external href="https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/services/user-services.html">Per-User Services documentation</Link> and made the following changes to the run script.

```diff
 #!/bin/sh

-export USER="<username>"
-export HOME="/home/<username>"
+export USER="iain"
+export HOME="/home/$USER"
+
+export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR="/run/user/$(id -u $USER)"
+mkdir $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
+chown $USER:$USER $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR

 groups="$(id -Gn "$USER" | tr ' ' ':')"
 svdir="$HOME/service"
```

This creates the users runtime directory and sets the permissions on system start up. For me, it's not a huge issue to do this before the user logs in as I only have the one user on my computer but if you wanted to wait for the user to login before creating it, you could modify the script to check that the output of `w` contains the user's username before continuing to execute.

### DBUS
For `pipewire-pulse` to work, it needs to be running in a DBUS session. To do this, we need to install `dbus` and enable the service.
```sh
sudo xbps-install dbus
sudo ln -s /etc/sv/dbus /var/service/
```

Then we can change the line in `~/.xinitrc` that starts your window manager to use `dbus-run-session` instead of `exec`.

```diff
-exec bspwm
+dbus-run-session bspwm
```

To check that it's working correctly, start your X session, open a terminal and check that the `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` environment variable is set.

## Running pipewire
Pipewire can be run using `runit`, however it is recommended that it's run in the user session. To do this, you can add the following lines to your window managers auto start programs. For `bspwm`, that means adding the following lines to your `~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc` file

```sh
#!/bin/sh

pkill pipewire
pkill pipewire-pulse
# ...
pipewire &
pipewire-pulse &
# ...
```

Now when `bspwm` starts up, you should have `pipewire` and `pipewire-pulse` running in the background.

## Managing audio IO settings

To manage your audio inputs and outputs, I like to use `pavucontrol`. This package is a simple GUI interface for controlling audio devices and their settings/configuration.

First install it with

```sh
sudo xbps-install pavucontrol
```

then in your terminal, run `pavucontrol`.

In the Outputs tab, you should be able to see a list of your output devices. If you can see them then your pipewire setup is ready to go!
